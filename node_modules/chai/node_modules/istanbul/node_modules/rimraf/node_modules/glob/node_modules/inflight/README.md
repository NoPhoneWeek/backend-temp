# inflight

Add callbacks to requests in flight to avoid async duplication

## USAGE

```javascript
var inflight = require('inflight')

// some request that does some stuff
function req(key, callback) {
  // key is any random string.  like a url or filename or whatever.
  //
  // will return either a falsey value, indicating that the
  // request for this key is already in flight, or a new callback
  // which when called will call all callbacks passed to inflightk
  // with the same key
  callback = infligh
